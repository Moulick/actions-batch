# actions-batch

A prototype for turning GitHub Actions into a batch job runner.

In the 1970s - or so I hear, [time-sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing) was all the rage, with users being able to submit tasks or batch jobs to large computers, and to collect the results when the jobs where done.

## Goal

Run a shell script in an isolated, immutable environment, collect the logs or results.

This works well with self-hosted runners managed by actuated (which use a full VM) or GitHub's hosted runners. It may also work with container-based runners, with some limitations on what software can be used securely i.e. `docker`.

See an example:

## What's supported?

* [x] Public repos
* [x] Private repos
* [x] Self-hosted runners
* [x] GitHub-hosted runners
* [x] Using secrets via repository secrets
* [x] Downloading the results of a build as an artifact

## How it works

1. You write a bash script like the ones in [examples](examples) and pass it in as an argument
1. A new repo is created with a random name in the specified organisation
2. A workflow file is written to the repo along with the shell script, the workflow's only job is to run the shell script and exit
3. The workflow is triggered and you can check the results

`-owner` is intended to be a GitHub organisation, but this can be adapted to a personal account by passing `--org false` to the command.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:alexellis/actions-batch
cd actions-batch
```

You'll need a Personal Access Token (PAT) with: delete_repo, repo, workflow, write:packages.

For a personal account using a hosted runner and a public repo:

```bash
go build
./actions-batch \
  --owner alexellis \
  --token-file ~/pat.txt \
  --runs-on ubuntu-latest \
  --file examples/cowsay.sh
```

For an organisation, using an Arm-based private repo and custom runner with 32vCPU and 256GB of RAM

```bash
go build
./actions-batch \
  --private \
  --owner actuated-samples \
  --token-file ~/pat.txt \
  --runs-on actuated-arm64-32cpu-256gb \
  --file examples/slim.sh
```

Example of what's written to the repo:

```bash
name: workflow

# Generated by alexellis/actuated-batch at: 2022-10-07 20:14:30.547822 +0100 BST m=+0.002729293
# Job requested by alex

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - '*'
  push:
    branches:
      - master
      - main

jobs:
  workflow:
    name: agitated_solomon5
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Run the job
        run: |
          chmod +x ./job.sh
          ./job.sh
```

## Consuming secrets within the script

A folder can be given, where each file is a secret, the name will be the filename made uppercase, with `-` replaced by `_`.

Take the following example to log into OpenFaaS:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -e -x -o pipefail

curl -sLS https://get.arkade.dev | sudo sh

arkade get faas-cli --quiet
sudo mv $HOME/.arkade/bin/faas-cli /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/faas-cli 

echo "${OPENFAAS_GATEWAY_PASSWORD}" | faas-cli login -g "${OPENFAAS_URL}"/function/printer -u admin --password-stdin
curl -h "X-Url: ${OPENFAAS_URL}" https://openfaas.o6s.io/function/printer 
```

Therefore just create two files:

```bash
mkdir -p .secrets
echo "admin password" > .secrets/openfaas-gateway-password
echo "https://gateway.example.com" > .secrets/openfaas-url
```

Then run the script passing in that folder:

```bash
go build && ./actions-batch \
  --private=false \
  --owner alexellis \
  --token-file ~/batch \
  --runs-on ubuntu-latest \
  --org=false \
  --file examples/secret.sh \
  --secrets-from .secrets
```

[OpenFaaS can be exposed over the Internet using an inlets tunnel](https://inlets.dev/blog/2020/10/15/openfaas-public-endpoints.html).

## Downloading the result of a build

You may be processing a video with ffmpeg, building a binary, a container image, PDF, or even an ISO.

Place the result in a folder named `uploads` and the contents will be uploaded as an artifact to GitHub Actions, before being downloaded to your machine and extracted for you to view.

Bear in mind that if your artifact is confidential or private, then you will need to use the `--private` flag to create a private repo.

A good example is [examples/youtubedl.sh](examples/youtubedl.sh) which downloads a video from YouTube.

```bash
go build && ./actions-batch \
  --private true \
  --owner actuated-samples \
  --token-file ~/batch \
  --runs-on actuated \
  --file ./examples/youtubedl.sh
```

Output:

```bash
Wrote 43.84kB to /tmp/uploads1127046452
Extracting: /tmp/artifacts-968188/video.flv
2023/12/21 16:04:01 extracted zip into /tmp/artifacts-968188: 1 files, 0 dirs (672.583Âµs)

video.flv 47.39kB

xdg-open /tmp/artifacts-968188/video.flv
```

## What's left

[See the issue tracker for ideas](https://github.com/alexellis/actions-batch/issues)

The Rate Limit for a Personal Access Token is quite limited, so this would need to be run as a GitHub App.
